# Exploratory Data Analysis of my LinkedIn Connections

**Data Collection**
* First step in any analysis is to obtain good quality data.
* LinkedIn provides various csv files (Connections/Messages) on which one can perform different types of analysis.
* To obtain these csv files , please follow the below path.  
  `Login to your LinkedIn Account` --> `Click on 'Me' icon located on top right corner` --> `Select Settings and Privacy` --> `Go to 'How LinkedIn Uses your Data'` --> `Select 'Get a Copy of your Data'` --> `Select whatever data you want`
  
  **Smaller Archive** (second option) will be ready for **download in 10 minutes** whereas **larger archive** (first option) will be ready for **download within 24 hours** of your request.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
* I have performed exploratory data analysis using the **Connections.csv** file.
* Things which I wanted to explore are listed below:    
  a) How many **different companies my connections** are working in ?  
  b) Which are the **top 10 companies** on the basis of the **no of connections corresponding to a company** ?  
  c) What are the **top 10 roles** on the basis of the **no of connections corresponding to each role** ?  
  d) What are the **no of connections** added each year ?  
  e) Which are **months when I have got connected** with the people the most ?  

This type of analysis will help me to know with which companies' people as well as the roles I should connect more so as to be aligned with my goal.
